Ridiculous reference materials demonstrating using Azure Cognitive Services to build intelligent applications using C# code

## Tasks

I want to get the following tasks done for demos:

Repository:
- [ ] Expand the `README.md` to include a description of the project and getting started configuration
- [ ] Expand the `README.md` to include links to helpful content I've made

Global App:
- [x] Set the basic layout of the desktop app
- [x] Global Navigation
- [x] Global error handling in the desktop app
- [x] Add a place in the desktop app to enter your cognitive services keys / endpoints
- [x] Save Settings to a Settings File

Images:

- [ ] Add a "take a picture" button to the desktop app
- [ ] Add an "upload picture" button to the desktop app
- [ ] Add an "drop picture here" button to the desktop app
- [ ] Object bounding boxes on image analysis view
- [ ] Image Analysis view 
- [ ] JSON View of Image Results

Text / Chat:
